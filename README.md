ðŸš— Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project presents a comprehensive and real-time driver drowsiness detection system aimed at improving road safety by identifying signs of driver fatigue before they lead to accidents.
With the alarming rise in road accidents caused by driver inattention and fatigue, the need for intelligent, non-intrusive monitoring systems has never been greater.

Our system uses a standard webcam and computer vision techniques to monitor the driverâ€™s eye movements in real time. By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) from facial landmarks, it detects prolonged eye closure â€” a key indicator of drowsiness â€” and triggers an alert to prevent potential mishaps.
